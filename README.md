sweetie, you are literally so out of line it’s fucking unbelievable.
i could drag you so hard right now but i know you’ll just end up crying.
i’ve roasted you before and you know it. chances are you’ll just say i
bullied you because you’re gay and have different skin. talk shit get
hit, you don’t wanna mess with me kiddo; i’ve got a black belt. i know
threats are fucked up but that’s all i’ve been receiving all day, probably
from her royal hoodrat olive and all of her nasty friends. but you can gang
up on me and make fun of me for being goth all you want. i’ve been hurt a lot.
my first boyfriend cheated on me, my dad screams if i forget to do my
chores, and there are some days i don’t even want to get out of bed in the
mornings. i’m a jaded teenage girl. i’ve been through shit that you wouldn’t
even dream of. you think your life is hard? try asking the cutest guy in your
grade out in the middle of the cafeteria only to find out he has a fucking
girlfriend. you don’t know my life or my story so keep my name out of your
nasty mouth. life is a battlefield and it looks like i’ve already won.
